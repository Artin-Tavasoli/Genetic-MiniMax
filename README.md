## ðŸŽ® Part 2: Implementing Pentago with the Minimax Algorithm

**Objective:**  
Develop a playable Pentago game with an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm.

**Game Description:**  
Pentago is a two-player abstract strategy game played on a 6Ã—6 board divided into four 3Ã—3 quadrants.  
Players take turns placing a marble and then rotating one of the quadrants 90Â° in either direction.  
The goal is to align five of your marbles in a rowâ€”horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

**Minimax Algorithm:**  
- Uses depth-limited search for AI decision-making  
- Integrates Alpha-Beta pruning to improve efficiency  
- AI difficulty can be adjusted by changing the `depth` parameter  
  *(Note: Higher depth = stronger AI but slower computation)*

**Results:**  
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of Alpha-Beta pruning through simulations  
- Created a fully playable Pentago game featuring a human vs. AI opponent  
- Preview shown below:
